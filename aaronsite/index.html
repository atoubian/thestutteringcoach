          <h3>My stuttering journey</h3>
          <p>
            Hello, my name is Aaron Toubian. I was born and raised in the city
            of Los Angeles. At the age of four, I suffered a traumatic accident
            in which I nearly drowned in a pool. I ultimately developed a
            stutter in the aftermath of the incident. My family searched far and
            wide for a trained professional who could help me with my speech. I
            eventually became a student of Vivian Sheehan. After years of being
            frustrated with my difficulties in everyday social situations,
            Vivian provided me with the tools to succeed. My stuttering issues
            no longer became something I was defined by. My voice was always
            within me -- and fortunately I was able to find it. Using my
            past/present experiences as a template, it is now my goal to give
            back and help those who also deal with stuttering. I once dealt with
            self-esteem issues, shame, guilt and depression. I failed to love
            myself, and it was impacting my day-to-day life. This included
            interpersonal dialogue such as speaking on the phone, ordering food
            in public, any sort of job interview, and also adversely effecting
            my ability to make friends. With my teaching program, I combine the
            methods I have learned in addition to a list of tools you can use to
            thrive in these social situations. My aim to help your
            self-confidence blossom with a methodical framework one can
            reference time and time again. Everyone is owed the chance to live
            their life to the fullest. By finding your voice, the hope is that
            this dream will become a reality.
